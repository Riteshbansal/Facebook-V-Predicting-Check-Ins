# Facebook-V-Predicting-Check-Ins
Abstract:
In the past decade, Facebook has become one of the most used social networking site in the world with around 2.2 billion monthly active users in 2018. The user check-ins on Facebook and other social media platforms have seen a colossal increase in popularity, thus the associated task of predicting check-in locations. Ability to predict not only can improve businesses outreach but also provides an opportunity to scale their operations. In this project, we will try to train a model on an artificial world to predict up to three check-in locations.
